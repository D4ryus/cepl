;;
;; - Gmap runs a pipeline with the input and then returns a framebuffer
;; - the current framebuffer is in the %current-fbo var.
;;
;; Given that, if we are inside a with-bind-fbo, we know what the the
;; fbo will be, then we can return the local var and not have to query
;; the special var which would have an overhead associated with it.
;; Q: is this moot because of having to set %current-fbo
;; A: I hope not, I think given correct settings the compiler may be able
;;    to optimize away this let as nothing uses it.
