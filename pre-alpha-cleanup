Ok so we are going to kill as many of the cases where :: is used

* find your targets with grep -nHIir -e "::" *
- done, can justify all of them now

* expose +default-resolution+
- done :)

* remove cepl.lisp
- Done! took a lot of shuffling to get most of the logic into context.lisp

* camera 'frame-size is a vector, this doesnt match other resolutions
* I actually dont like the resolutions being lists rather than vectors
  but I hate not bein able to #'apply the resolution to a function.
  What if EVERYTHING in cepl that took a resolution could take either
  vector or list? Would it hurt our ability to optimize anywhere?
- Done the 'make it a list bit' but not the second bullet point

* should v:x->w be exposed in cepl? it feels like something we would do so
  often that it should be there...maybe leave that to users/ceplive
- yeah that is for others to decide

* default-resolution doesnt know about viewport calls on default framebuffer
  This is a shame. We can start by making viewport set this, but then we get
  issue where we are hoping all state is managed through cepl...may add it for
  now and re-examine it later.

* sdl.evt sucks, just make it evt
- done

* #'clear-fbo should be #'clear with optional fbo arg
- done (kinda)

* mesh.lisp has package cgl..why?
- now in "meshes" package

* add %px to def-compose-dispatch. It is a symbolmacro that expands to (%view-pixel-size)
  which is a local func that

* what in examples specifies a package, why? Mainly interested in cgl:

* remove cls
- done
