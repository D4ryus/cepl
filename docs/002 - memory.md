# Memory

### Where's my data?

With CEPL data can exist in three different places:

- lisp memory - The regular lisp data in your program. This get's GC'd (garbage collected)
- c memory - Data stored in block of cffi memory. This does not get GC'd
- gpu memory - Data stored on the GPU. This does not get GC'd

CEPL makes moving data between these places easy.

### GC

Garbage collection is our friend in lisp. GC facilitates the use our REPLs for experimental bliss and allows data structures that would be a nightmare to maintain otherwise.

However, in realtime graphics the GC *can* be a problem. Stable frame rate is a major requirement, and spikes in GC activity can cause problems. It is clearly possible to have a GC and make games, but the core systems have to be written sensibly to ensure they aren't adding load.

Communication with the GPU at the wrong time can be very expensive. Freeing GPU memory used by the current render state is a recipe for disaster.  To this end, by default, none of the data in c-memory or gpu-memory is GC'd. This obviously means you need to free this data yourself, or you will end up with memory leaks.

We say "by default" as there are certain times you may not mind paying the cost. For example, when you are playing with ideas in the REPL. To this end we are exploring ways of providing this capability without compromising any performance in the rest of CEPL. This is WIP so this doc will be updated when that is in place.

### #'free and #'free-*

To release memory we have two options, firstly we can use the generic function #'free as in
```
(free some-cepl-data)
```
However you may not want to pay the dispatch cost in performance critical code, so there are a number of `free-*` functions (e.g. #'free-c-array #'free-gpu-array etc). These specific functions will be covered in their respective chapters.

### #'pull-g & #'push-g

These are two very helpful generic functions that let you move data between lisp, c-memory &
gpu-memory with ease!

`push-g` will take a lisp array or lisp list and push the data into a c-array or a gpu-array (dont worry if you dont know what these are yet)

`pull-g` will pull data from c-array ï¼† gpu-arrays and bring it back into lisp.

Obviously the generic dispatch and working out how to upload the data to a given target takes time, so these are generally used in non performance critical places, like the repl!

There is also a bit more to this but we will revisit these in a later chapter.
